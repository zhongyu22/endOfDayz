        The `step` method for the tracking zombie will move the tracking zombie

        the distance between the resultant position and the player's position.
        The resultant position is the position resulting from moving the
        tracking zombie in a direction.

        distance from the player, the direction should be picked in preference

        * Moving 'N' will give a resultant position of (1, 2), which is a
          distance of 3 from the player
        * Moving 'E' will give a resultant position of (2, 1) which is a
          distance of 3 from the player
        * Moving 'W' will give a resultant position of (0, 1) which is a
          distance of 5 from the player
        * Moving 'S' will give a resultant position of (1, 0) which is a
          distance of 5 from the player
          
        In this situation 'N' and 'E' compete for best direction so 'N' is
        picked, 'W' and 'S' are also equidistant so 'W' is picked, causing an
        order of 'N', 'E', 'W', 'S' to be chosen.
